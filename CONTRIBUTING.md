# Contributing
If you would like to contribute code to OpenVox you can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.

To make the process smooth for the project committers (those who review and accept changes) and contributors (those who propose new changes via pull requests) please follow the guidelines.  When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.  The [Style-Guide](https://github.com/VoxelGameDev/OpenVox/wiki/Style-Guide) contains the conventions used.
